# Files and Folders Rules Evaluation Engine (FFREE)

The Files and Folders Rules Evaluation Engine (FFREE, pronounced /ˈɛf-fri/) is a general-purpose rule processing engine and toolkit to create and evaluate XML-based rules on files and folders.
The XML files generated by the toolkit and processed by the engine must strictly abide by version-specific XML Schema which can be found in the repository.
FFREE makes extensive use of the C++17 [filesystem library](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/filesystem) for file and directory traversal.
